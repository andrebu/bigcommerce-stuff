<p>We started DankStop because just like you, we were tired of the unreliable online headshops out there. With the exception of few, local stores always seem to charge a fortune for limited selections of mediocre glass. We noticed that other online shops were sketchy, had terrible customer service, and you never knew if you'd actually receive your products. We decided to change that by offering the best customer service out there. Feel free to contact our support team by phone, email, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Dankstop" target="_blank">Facebook message</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/dankstop/" target="_blank">Instagram DM</a>, snail mail, or send a pigeon. We will always respond within 24 hours.</p>

	<p>Dank Stop was created to revolutionize the online headshop market by offering a simple layout that's easy to navigate and locate exactly what you're looking for. By combining our easy to use site with only the best quality products, top notch service, and FREE shipping on all orders, we make sure every customer is satisfied.</p>
