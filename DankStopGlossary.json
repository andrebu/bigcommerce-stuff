Unlike most grinder companies that use sharp teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder uses square teeth. Sharp-edged teeth dull from metal fatigue and contain burr and tiny flakes of aluminum that can fall into your smoking blend. By using square teeth, Santa Cruz Shredder avoids this extremely unhealthy possibility. The grinders are &#x3C;span&#x3E;fabricated out of a single piece of high grade CNC aluminum to provide durability and a consistent grind. Santa Cruz Shredder &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/grinders/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;grinders&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are totally scratch resistant through a process called Anodizing, which&#xA0;&#x3C;span&#x3E;creates a protective coating for aluminum that prevents wear resistance, failing of threaded parts, and corrosion.&#xA0;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;They use top-of-the-line magnets and screens. The magnets they use are Neodymium Diametrically Magnetized Cylindrical Rare Earth Magnets which create a triple layer of Nickel and Copper to prevent against corrosion and abuse. Santa Cruz Shredder uses T304 Microbic Precision Woven Non-Fraying Stainless Steel Screens which has a high micron size that allows less impurities to pass through into the pollen chamber. The clean design and innovative technology of Santa Cruz Shredder &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/grinders&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;grinders&#x3C;/a&#x3E; create a healthy, enjoyable, and efficient smoking experience. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://dankstop.com/brands/Santa-Cruz-Shredder.html&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;Check out more products from Santa Cruz Shredder&#x3C;/a&#x3E;."

  "feature": {
    "perc": {
      "diffused downstem": "This is the most simple design for a percolator. The glass straight tube has slits or holes at its base under the water which allows the smoke to cool down as it travels through it.",
      "tree": "When it comes to tree percs, the more arms it has the more diffusion that can happen, creating a larger separation of the smoke. The arms of the tree usually have slits on the side, and constructed with either a closed or open bottom. Smaller slits lead to smaller bubbles which results in more diffusion, filtration, and percolation.",
      "disc": "Disc percolators are circular percs which resemble a disc. Disc percs have slits or holes for filtration and diffusion. They usually come in specific types such as turbine disc percs, honeycomb percs, or ratchet disc percs.",
      "turbine disc": "Turbine disc percs are a type of diffusion system consisting of a solid disc of angled slits placed inside the water chamber. The angled slits create a spinning effect which both cools and diffuses the smoke while creating a unique visual effect.",
      "crystal ball": "Crystal ball percs are a circular perc with angled slits intertwining across it. Its shape and the intertwining slits make the perc appear like a crystal ball.",
      "dome": "Dome percolators are called this because of their shape. They have slits and holes where the dome touches the bottom. Diffusion happens when the smoke passes through the dome, and separates when going through the holes or slits.",
      "barrel": "Barrel percolators are a specific type of dome perc. They have more slits than a traditional dome perc, while the inner chamber isn 't as large which creates less drag.",
      "showerhead": "Showerhead percolators have a thin vertical tube that widens into a round chamber. They have slits or holes for increased filtration and diffusion. Their name comes from their resemblance to a showerhead.",
      "honeycomb": "Honeycomb percs are a type of disc perc, but they have more diffusion because they usually have at least 30 small holes through which the smoke must pass. The holes must be the correct size because large holes won't filter the smoke efficiently and small holes will create too much drag.",
      "ratchet": "atchet percs are a type of disc perc with holes lining the perimeter of the disc to increase filtration and the flow of smoke.",
      "waffle": "Waffle percs are similar to disc percs except they have holes rather than slits. Their appearance is similar to that of a waffle fry.",
      "matrix": "Matrix percs are a cylindrical chamber with vertical and horizontal slits or grooves.",
      "stereo matrix": "Stereo matrix percs consist of two smaller matrix percolators stacked on top of each other. This usually occurs in larger water pipes with two chambers, where one matrix perc is housed in each chamber.",
      "reti": "Reti percolators consist of two cylinders, with a smaller one inside a larger one. Diffusion occurs when smoke passes through the slits of the cylinders.",
      "ufo": "UFO percs feature a rounded top with a glass circle base. They have a series of slits around the circumference of the glass circle. Smoke passes through these slits to create serious diffusion and filtration. UFO percs are often sought after because of their efficiency and ease of cleaning.",
      "swiss": "Swiss percs are a vertical diffusion system with holes on a large disc. The name derives from the percolators resemblance to swiss cheese.",
      "inline": "Inline percolators are a straight perc composed of a slit or gridded tube inside a perpendicular chamber.",
      "stemline": "Stemline percs are a type of inline percolator that branches straight off of the joint.",

      "cross": "Cross percs are one of the latest inventions from one of the leading percolator innovators out there, JM Flow. This percolator has an intricate design with a circular center with multiple circle pieces branching out from it. Each of these circles has slits in the form of a cross that leads to the most smoke filtration and a smoother hit for the smoker.",
      "inset": "Inset percs are contained inside the chamber of the water pipe and are an indented perc that creates a pocket. Inset percolators have slits around their circumference to filter and diffuse the smoke.",
      "circ": "A circ perc is a circular percolator that usually contains numerous rings with spacing between them. This spacing and the holes/slits of the perc allow for intense filtration.",
      "sprinkler": "A sprinkler perc is a circular perc featuring multiple tubes branching out in all directions. Similar to a tree perc, the smoke goes through the circular part and leaves out through the many different arms. The separation of the smoke/vapor causes filtration and diffusion for optimal pulls.",
      "j-hook": "A J-Hook perc gets its name because it has the shape of an upside-down J. It usually connects to a different type of perc and is generally houses in the upper chamber of a water pipe or concentrate rig.",
      "tongue": "A tongue perc resembles a tongue and its unique design has slits and holes to rigorously diffuse and filter vapor and smoke."

    "dab rig": {
      "aka": "concentrate pipe",
      "description": "Dab Rigs (also known as vapor rigs, concentrate rigs, concentrate pipes, or oil rigs) are a specific type of water pipe used for the consumption of essential oils, legal concentrates, and legal waxes. Vapor Rigs feature a joint (10mm, 14mm, or 18mm) and have a different process depending on the type of nail used. With a standard dome and nail, simply remove the dome and heat the nail with a butane torch. Place the dome back over the nail and use a dabber or dab tool to put the desired amount of concentrates on to the nail and inhale. A domeless nail requires the same process except with more convenience as there is no need to remove and replace the dome. The essential oils will vaporize due to the high temperature of the nail, and vapor will travel through the concentrate rig ready for smooth inhalation."

      "description": "Recyclers are a type of dab rig that features a unique dual chamber design. The main chamber houses the perc, or in some cases multiple percolators, that begin the diffusion process. After the vapor and water travel through the main chamber, it moves through separation tubes to the recycling chamber. Because of these concentrate rigs’ functional design, the water and vapor loop between the two chambers. The vapor passes through the percs multiple times before leaving out of the mouthpiece, ensuring that it is completely filtered and smooth."
