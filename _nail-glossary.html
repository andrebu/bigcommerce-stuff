		<p>Here at DankStop, we get a lot of questions on the different types of nails. To make your life simpler, we’ve created the following infographic below that explains everything you need to know about domed nails, domeless nails, banger nails, universal nails, and many more.</p>
		<p>Nails are absolutely essential to the dabbing process. If you’re new to concentrates or want to learn more, check out <a href="https://dankstop.com/whats-a-dab-rig-oil-rig" title="What's a Dab Oil Rig?">our article on dab rigs and dabbing</a>. Without a nail, dabbing would be impossible, as it is where you place your legal concentrates and essential oils. DankStop carries a wide variety of nails, and we know that not everybody is an expert on the benefits and drawbacks of each type. By explaining each type of nail and how they function, we hope to reach our ultimate goal of finding you the perfect nail that fits your preferences and your particular vapor rig.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="dome-vs-domed"><h2>DOMED VS DOMELESS</h2></div>

	<div class="domed-nails">
		<h3>Domed Nails</h3>
		<p>These types of nails should be used with a dome to get maximum efficiency. Due to their specific design and how these nails function, having a dome will stop vapor from escaping into the air before it can be inhaled into your concentrate pipe.</p>
		<ul class="nail-list">
			<li class="nail-type">
				<div class="nails-left">
					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/glassnail.png%%" alt="Glass Nail" title="Glass Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Glass Nails</h4>
					<p>Glass nails are the default nail that comes with most dab rigs. Although they get the job done, glass nails are the most delicate of the 4 materials that are used in crafting the nails that we sell.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
						<li>Joint Genders: Fits Male Only</li>
						<li>Materials: Glass</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="nail-type">
				<div class="nails-left">
					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/adjustablenail.png%%" alt="Adjustable Nail" title="Adjustable Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Adjustable Nails</h4>
					<p>Adjustable nails get their name because they give you the option to adjust their height. The purpose of this feature is that these nails can be used with any size dome. With a large dome you can raise the nail while with a smaller dome you can lower the nail, allowing this nail to be at the optimal height no matter what the size of the dome it is paired with.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
						<li>Joint Genders: Fits Male Only</li>
						<li>Materials: Titanium or Ceramic</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="domeless-nails">
		<h3>Domeless Nails</h3>
		<p>Domeless nails make the whole process of using a concentrate pipe much simpler. Instead of using two separate tools in a dome and a nail, domeless nails combine the two and are manufactured with specific features that make domes excessive and unnecessary. Domeless nails are also safer because you don’t have to maneuver around the extremely hot nail (with a dome you would have to cap or remove it right near the nail).</p>
		<ul class="nail-list">

				<div class="nails-left">
					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/glassnail.png%%" alt="Universal Nail" title="Universal Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Universal</h4>
					<p>Universal nails refer to any nail that fits one of two categories. It either fits both genders (male and female) or it fits multiple joint sizes. Universal nails are fantastic for their versatility as well as great for someone who owns multiple pieces with differing joint sizes/genders.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
						<li>Joint Genders: Available for Male and Female</li>
						<li>Materials: Titanium and Ceramic</li>

				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Completely Universal</h4>
					<p>Completely universal nails fit not just multiple joint sizes, but also fit both gender joints. They are created in a way that no matter what type of rig you have, these nails will fit and work flawlessly. These nails live up to their name.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
						<li>Joint Genders: Fits Both Male and Female</li>
						<li>Materials: Titanium or Ceramic</li>

					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/honeybucket.png%%" alt="Honey Bucket Nail" title="Honey Bucket Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Honey Bucket</h4>
					<p>Honey Bucket nails are a combination of a banger nail and an inverted dome. The banger sits in an upside-down dome and is attached by a swinging arm. The swinging arm allows you to heat the nail outside of the bucket and place it safely back inside when you are ready to load your concentrates. This type of nail has a slit so that the vapor can travel into the rig.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
						<li>Joint Genders: Available for Female and Male</li>
						<li>Materials: Quartz</li>

					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/bangernail.png%%" alt="Banger Nail" title="Banger Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Banger</h4>
					<p>Banger nails are unique in that they have a curved shape that puts the nail at a distance from your joint. Since you are heating the nail further away from the joint, banger nails serve the function of preventing heat stress or fractures.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
						<li>Joint Genders: Fits Both Male and Female</li>
						<li>Materials: Titanium, Quartz, and Ceramic</li>

					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/directinjectnail.png%%" alt="Direct Inject Nail" title="Direct Inject Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Direct Inject</h4>
				<p>Direct inject nails fit directly into a male joint, similar to either a glass nail or an adjustable nail. The difference is that direct inject nails have a dish with a raised bowl, which makes them domeless as a dome is not needed. The vapor travels directly from the dish and is injected into the dab rig straight from the dish where the concentrates are vaporized.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
					<li>Joint Genders: Fits Male Joints</li>
					<li>Materials: Quartz and Ceramic</li>
				</ul>

					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/daisynail.png%%" alt="Daisy Nail" title="Daisy Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Daisy</h4>
				<p>Daisy nails contain a bowl design with multiple slits lining the circumference of the top of the dish. Concentrates are vaporized and the vapor travels through these slits and into the concentrate pipe.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
					<li>Joint Genders: Fits Both Male and Female</li>
					<li>Materials: Quartz</li>

					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/halonail.png%%" alt="Halo Nail" title="Halo Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Halo</h4>
				<p>Halo nails have a very unique appearance that is matched by the functionality of this innovative design. They have a dish for your concentrates with an arch going above it. The arch has numerous slits that allow the vapor to flow upwards into the slits and enter your dab rig.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Available Sizes: 14mm and 18mm</li>
					<li>Joint Genders: Fits Both Male and Female</li>
					<li>Materials: Quartz</li>

					<img src="%%ASSET_/images/wiki/glossary-different-types-nails/anglednail.png%%" alt="Angled Cut Nail" title="Angled Cut Nail" />
				</div>
				<div class="nails-right">
					<h4>Angled Cut</h4>
				<p>These nails get their name from the shape of their design. Instead of being flat, these nails are manufactured to have the quartz on a raised angle around the dish. The angle cut design provides an aesthetic appeal and a variation from the standard dish design.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Available Sizes: 10mm, 14mm, and 18mm</li>
					<li>Joint Genders: Fits Both Male and Female</li>
					<li>Materials: Quartz</li>
